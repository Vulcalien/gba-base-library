## Introduction

This C library contains data type definitions, drivers and functions
that I use in all GBA projects. Its aim is to reduce the overhead of
creating a project and offer a simple interface for some components of
the GBA.

### Building the library

(Instructions for Unix-like systems)

Firstly, make sure to have the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler installed.
Then, compile the library by running `make`. This will generate a static
library file in the `bin` directory.

### Using the library
