== DESCRIPTION
All of these functions take the _id_ argument, used to identify the
timers. This can be an integer between 0 and 3 or one of these
constants: *TIMER0*, *TIMER1*, *TIMER2*, *TIMER3*.

Each timer has its decrementing counter, with values between 1 and
*TIMER_COUNTER_MAX* (defined as 65536 = 2^16). When starting a timer, an
initial counter value has to be provided. Every time a timer ticks, its
counter is decremented until it reaches zero. Once that happens, the
counter will be immediately reset to the provided initial value and the
timer will continue running.

The *timer_config*() function configures the specified timer. The
_prescaler_ argument specifies how many CPU cycles are needed for the
timer to tick. Possible values are: *TIMER_PRESCALER_1*,
*TIMER_PRESCALER_64*, *TIMER_PRESCALER_256*, *TIMER_PRESCALER_1024*. +
The _cascade_ argument, if true, makes the timer tick only when the
counter of the previous timer (_id_ - 1) reaches zero. If _cascade_ is
true, _prescaler_ will be ignored.

The *timer_start*() function starts the specified timer and sets its
initial counter value to _ticks_. Before being started, the timer should
be properly configured by calling *timer_config*(). If the timer is
already running, this function will change the counter's initial value
without overwriting its current value.

The *timer_stop*() function stops the specified timer. Stopping a timer
does not reset its counter, nor does it affect its configuration.

The *timer_restart*() function does the same thing as *timer_start*(),
but first stops the specified timer. It is recommended to use this
function instead of *timer_start*() when the timer's state is either
running or unknown.

The *timer_get_counter*() function returns the specified timer's counter
value. Since stopping a timer does not reset its counter, it is safe to
call this function on stopped timers.

== NOTES
This library considers the timers to be decrementing (i.e., their
counters are decremented). In GBA hardware, and thus in documentation
regarding it, the timers are considered to be incrementing. When using
this driver and reading other GBA documentation, be aware of this
difference.
